# Space Game V3

A simple arcade-style space game where you control a spacecraft and shoot incoming asteroids. Navigate through space, avoid collisions, and rack up your high score!

## Background

This project started as a school assignment but has evolved into a personal hobby project. I'm developing it in my free time as a way to improve my Java skills and have fun with game development.

## Getting Started

To run this game locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code with Java extensions installed
3. Run the main class

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Future Development

This is an ongoing project with no defined scope. I'm working on it as inspiration strikes, and will continue to add features as I have time and interest.

Feel free to check back for updates!
